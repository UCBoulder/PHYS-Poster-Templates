# PowerPoint Poster Template

An editable PowerPoint poster template pre-configured with CU Boulder Physics branding. The slide is sized at **46.43" x 34.82"** (landscape) to fit the department's HP DesignJet Z6dr (36" roll) without scaling. See the [Poster Design Best Practices](../best-practices.md) guide for layout, typography, and image guidelines.

## What's Included

The template comes ready to use with:

- **Title banner** — black background with poster title, author names, affiliations, and logos
- **Three-column layout** — column headings with gold underlines
- **References and Acknowledgments** sections in column 3 with appropriate font sizing
- **Footer** — email, conference, and URL fields
- **Branding elements are grouped and locked** to prevent accidental edits (these can be unlocked and edited if needed)

## Getting Started

1. Open `poster.pptx` in PowerPoint.
2. Edit the title, authors, and affiliations in the header.
3. Add your content in each column using text boxes, figures, and tables.
4. Update the References and Acknowledgments sections.
5. Update the footer fields (email, conference name, URL).

## Logos

The template includes both the CU Boulder logo (left) and the Physics department logo (right). You can use one or both — delete the logo you don't need, or replace one with a funding agency or research group logo. To change a logo, select the one you want to change. Right-click and then select "Change Picture" from the menu.

## Adding Content

- **Text**: Add text boxes within the column areas. Use the column headings and guides for alignment.
- **Figures**: **Insert** > **Pictures**. Use high-resolution images (300 DPI at printed size).
- **Equations**: Use **Insert** > **Equation** for simple expressions. For complex equations, create them in LaTeX, export as a high-resolution PNG or PDF, and insert as an image.
- **Section headings**: Copy and paste an existing column heading to match the style.

## Export to PDF

1. **File** > **Save As** (or **Export**) > **PDF**.
2. Open the PDF and verify the layout before printing. See the [main README](../README.md#printing-on-the-department-hp-designjet-36-roll) for detailed print validation steps.

## Tips

- Use **View** > **Guides** and **Gridlines** to align elements precisely.
- Group related elements (Ctrl+G) so they move together.
- If sharing the .pptx file, embed fonts via **File** > **Options** > **Save** > **Embed fonts in the file**.
